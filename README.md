# bitcoin-prices
A line chart showing Bitcoin prices within a certain range made with AngularJS, ChartJS and Twitter Bootstrap.

Change the start date, end date and currency and the data will be rendered quickly without reloading the page.

A few rough edges at the moment but it's very fast and responsive.

You may have to run a local server from the directory of this project to run the page. E.g. http://lifehacker.com/start-a-simple-web-server-from-any-directory-on-your-ma-496425450
